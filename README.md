## Replace images
Put your real images here and keep the same file names:
- `src/assets/projects/network-project-1.jpg`
- `src/assets/projects/network-project-2.jpg`
- `src/assets/projects/school-app-1.jpg`
- `src/assets/projects/school-app-2.jpg`

## Add your photo/logo
Edit: `src/pages/Home.tsx` (Placeholder block is ready)


## Replacing project screenshots

Place your real screenshots inside `public/assets/projects/` and keep the same filenames (e.g., `school-1.svg` -> `school-1.jpg`). Update `src/data/projects.ts` if you want different names.
